                                            <p>There is no doubt that people enjoy free things, free shipping included making its advent gradually create a tremendous impact on customers' purchasing decisions.</p>
                                           
                                            <p>According to recent research by Statista, <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/871/online-shopping/#dossierContents__outerWrapper">73%</a> of online buyers are likely to purchase more items from e-Commerce stores that offer free shipping.</p>
                                            <P>However, it is worth noting that shipping is often associated with costs that include: postage, transportation, warehousing, fulfillment, and delivery costs.</P>
                                            <p>This now begs the following questions: what do e-commerce platforms do to ensure <a href="https://www.shipnetwork.com/resources">successful free shipping?</a></p> What is the impact of free shipping on e-commerce retailers?</p>
                                            <p>Keep reading to find out more about free shipping.</p>
                                            <h3>Is Free Shipping Entirely Free?</h3>
                                            <p>Many people argue that free shipping is a term used by e-commerce stores to cover the cost of shipping; hence there is nothing like free shipping. Now, this begs the question. Who pays for free shipping?</p> 
                                            <p>The e-Commerce company or the customer generally pays a shipping fee. e-Commerce stores have to deal with the question of whether or not they are planning to include the shipping price in the price of the items they are selling.</p>
                                            <p><a href="https://www.shipnetwork.com/partners/amazon"> Amazon</a>, for instance, offers a Prime membership program for its customers. The customer pays an annual fee in exchange for free shipping on some or all items purchased.</p>
                                            <h3>Advantages of Free Shipping for Consumers and Retailers</h3>

                                            <UL>	
                                            <li>Free shipping makes online selling more appealing. The mention of the word "free" instantly makes a product desirable to the consumer</li>
                                            <li>Easy decision-making – online customers shop faster and easier when shipping costs are eliminated</li>
                                            <li>Minimal shopping cart abandonment – online customers are less likely to abandon a shopping cart when they know free shipping costs</li>
                                            <li>Online customers are more likely to purchase products from the same e-commerce store if they are satisfied with the shipping and delivery services</li>
                                            </UL>
                                            <h3>Shortcomings of Free Shipping</h3>
                                            <p>Despite the advantages of free shipping, it is not without some disadvantages.</p>
                                            
                                            <h3>Free Shipping Equals a Higher Price</h3>
                                            <p>As previously stated, free shipping is only partially free. e-Commerce sites typically ship to a particular location on one of the coasts. Costs are often based on the items' weight and size. A larger or heavier item attracts high pay, and sometimes the cost may be too high.
                                            </p> 
                                            <p>For instance,the cost of an order increased from $13.50 to $21 as reported by a customer. Their average sale price was $58.75. As a result, margins dropped from 32% to 12.5%, affecting cash flow and posing a threat to their long-term strategy.</p>
                                            <p>In such a scenario, an e-Commerce company ought to find the right balance.</p> 
                                            <p>Should they offer free shipping and increase the prices of their items? </p>
                                            <p>Will they be willing to provide free shipping in exchange for minimal returns?</p>
                                            <h3>The Need To Make Adjustments When Shipping Rates Change</h3>
                                            <p>An online store may have to deal with fluctuating shipping rates. For instance, postage costs have a tendecy to increase regularly and akin to the scenario mentioned above, the online store will face a decrease in profit. However, an online store can increase its e-Commerce products' prices to prevent profit margins from dropping further.</p>
                                            <h3>Economy Shipping</h3>
                                            <p>An online store may decide to share shipping costs with its customers, affecting shipping speed. Customers can buy shipping promotions that are usually cheaper than regular shipping charges. Thus, the online store passes on an agreed portion of shipping costs to the customer – economy shipping – affecting delivery times.</p> 
                                            <p>Economy shipping could not appeal to most internet customers, and it is only prudent for an online store to take its time before considering the economy shipping scheme. The 80-20 rule may apply in this case, although some customers also prefer expedited shipping which attracts increased costs.</p>
                                            <h3>Free shipping on e-Commerce and Logistics</h3>
                                            <p>Shipping is vital in online retailers' fulfillment, supply chain, and logistics. AI is being used to streamline and make shipping more efficient. When an online store provides free shipping, it indicates that it understands the needs of its customers, making the purchase process relatively painless for them.</p>
                                            <h3>Should An e-Commerce Store Offer Free Shipping?</h3>
                                            <p>There is no doubt that free shipping has had a significant impact on the e-Commerce and logistics industries. On the whole, most customers prefer the idea of free shipping instead of discounts.They are also likely to return to the same online store if it offers free shipping.</p> 
                                            <p>Even though shipping costs may be high on the retailer's end, the latest research reveals that 50% of e-Commerce lovers increase their orders when an e-Commerce store offers free shipping. In short, free shipping can be the difference between a successful and a failing online store.<p>
